# textractor: Text Searcher OCR

## About this app

This simple application scans & extracts text from images as simple as that by using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It is a text scanner, text recognizer, text reader, image scanner, image to text converter, call it whatever!

What make this application special is that it allows you to search for words, and sentences on an image and without internet. And you will be able to do more operations on the extracted text.

Note: Unfortunately this stupid application can't extract hand written text from an image and can recognize text in only Latin-based language. Sorry :(

### Why would I use textractor?
- Convert image to text with fast and high accuracy text extraction
- Search for words or sentences (with a limit of 26 letters) on the image
- Edit extracted text
- Copy extracted text to the clipboard
- Share extracted text on Email, Facebook, Whatsapp, Messanger, etc.

### How can I use textractor?
- Use your gallery: you can select any image with text from your gallery
- Use your camera: you can take images with text and it is recommended to take sharp images with good lighting for best results

### Is that it?
No, textractor is still under development, and more features and improvements will be added in the future such as:
- UI & UX improvements
- Translation
- Supporting more languages
- Keep history of scanned images
